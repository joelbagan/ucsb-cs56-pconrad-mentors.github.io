The process:

1. Go through and make sure all paper is facing the right way.  Set aside any stapled, paper clipped, or other "odd" papers.
2. Scan papers to a PDF file.
3. Go to <https://gradescope.com> and pull up the course.  Go to the page where you can add an assignment.
4. You will need a PDF of the assignment.  The course page is here: <https://ucsb-cs56-f17.github.io>.  Find the homework, and "print to PDF".
5. Upload the PDF.  Name the assignment exactly what it is named on the course page (e.g. h00, h01, ic02, etc.)
