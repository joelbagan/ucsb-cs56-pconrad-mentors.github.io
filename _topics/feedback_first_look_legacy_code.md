# Handling pull request for first look at legacy code (e.g. F16 lab03)

These instructions pertain to:

* [M16 lab02](https://ucsb-cs56-m16.github.io/lab/lab02/)
* [F16 lab03](https://ucsb-cs56-f16.github.io/lab/lab03/)

So, "accepting" or "not accepting" the pull request for this lab is your responsibility.  You should have the authority (meaning the github.com permissions) to do so.  If you don't, ask the TA or instructor to adjust the settings (or even a fellow mentor that does have access.)   As a mentor, you should be an "owner" of the UCSB-CS56-Projects organization.

To decide whether to accept the pull request for the legacy code code review is usually easy.

If the only change is adding a <tt>{{page.example_md_file}}</tt> file, then just accept the pull request no matter what.

If they have also made changes that involve changes to code--i.e. fixing things that they might want to get points towards a future lab lab04, then see the page [Feedback on Legacy Code First Deadline](/topics/feedback_legacy_code_first_deadline/) page for more instructions.

# After accepting the pull request

Immediately after accepting it, go into the [feedback repo](/topics/create_feedback_repo/) for that pair and add feedback under a heading for this lab.  (This may be under a heading in the README.md, or in a separate file with the name of the lab in question; this convention is still TBD as of 3:35pm October 27, 2016.  Please resolve this on the slack channel, then update this page accordingly.)

The feedback you should add is this:  Check the items in lab instructions (e.g. * [F16 lab03](https://ucsb-cs56-f16.github.io/lab/lab03/)) .   For each one, did they do it or not?   

You are not assigning a "grade", but you are making a check list and commenting on each item and drawing attention to things that are either particularly good, acceptable, or missing or problematic.  Think of it as making a checklist of  +, ok, -.  

Note that this is *not a grade*.  It is "feedback".  

True: the TAs might use it in deciding where to put their attention when assigning a grade, but they will make an indepdendent judgement before doing so.    This is a *very* important distinction to preserve, not just as a "notion", but in spirit and in truth.

You may also add some encouraging comment or hints about what the students should be doing as they move into the "complete the first 250 or 500 points of their assignment" phase (i.e. the lab where they have the first deadline for work on the legacy code project.)
