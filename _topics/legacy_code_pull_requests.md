The first thing you should do is to [create a feedback repo](/topics/create_feedback_repo/) for the pair, individual or trio if you have not already done so.

The process is explained at the link here: [create a feedback repo](/topics/create_feedback_repo/)

The rest is explained here: [legacy code progress](/topics/legacy_code_progress/)

Eventually, I'll refactor these articles so they flow better.
