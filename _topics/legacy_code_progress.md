This article describes what mentors should be doing during the time that students are assigned to work on legacy code, 
such as during this lab from M16:

* [UCSB CS56 M16 lab04](http://ucsb-cs56-m16.github.io/lab/lab04/)

By the end of the lab meeting where lab04 is introduced, the following should be true:

* You've [created a feedback repo for each of your teams](/topics/creating_feedback_repos/)
* You've handled the [pull request from lab02](/topics/pull_request_first_look_legacy_code/) and added feedback to their repos for it&mdash;at least as far as you can given their state of completion.
* You've communicated with each of your mentees about their labs for completion for lab04, and you've recorded some feedback on that in their feedback repo.

More on each of these items below.

# Creating Feedback Repos

See [created a feedback repo for each of your teams](/topics/creating_feedback_repos/).  Do this first.

# Check in with each pair (trio, individual)

The most important thing for you to do during lab is to *proactively* check in with *each pair* (or individual or trio) assigned to you
that should be there in lab.

The first thing to check is: "did they show up?"  If they did not, send them a message (I suggest via private message on Piazza, cc'd to "Instructors")
that asks about their welfare.    You can keep it friendly, and you can "assume", to help them save face, that they are not in lab for a good reason, i.e.
that they are sick, had a car accident, etc.   So, ask something like the following.  Put it in your own words, using whatever
way of communicating is natural for you.

>    I'm concerned because I didn't see you in lab.  
>    Is everything ok? I hope you are not sick, and that you were not in an accident, etc.
>    Please check in with me about your progress as soon as you can.  
>    As your mentor, I'm responsible (for my
>    own course grade) to help you succeed in the course as best I can.
>    Please let me know where you stand with (here, mention whatever work is due).

# Checking on their progress

The second thing is to check on their progress.  Students may have a tendency to be "behind", say working on lab03, when they should be finished with it by now and working on lab04.  Or they may not even have finished lab02.

In this case, encourage them to finish up lab03 (or lab02, or whatever), and try to get them to commit to some timeline for finishing.  Ask if they 
are "stuck" on anything specific.  

In general, encourage your mentees to be in touch with you, or post on Piazza, if they run into problems.
Remind them that they can post private messages to you on Piazza.  Remind them they can include, or not include, their instructors,
their pair partners, etc. on those messages.

# Handling pull request for lab02.

So, "accepting" or "not accepting" the pull request for lab02 is your responsibility.  You should have the authority (meaning the github.com permissions) to do so.  If you don't, ask the TA or instructor to adjust the settings (or even a fellow mentor that does have access.)   As a mentor, you should be an "owner" of the UCSB-CS56-Projects organization.

To decide whether to accept the pull request for the legacy code code review is usually easy.

If they only change is an M16_lab02.md file, then just accept the pull request no matter what.

Immediately after accepting it, go into the github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/FEEDBACK_githubid1_githubid2 repo for that pair and add feedback under the lab02 heading.

The feedback you should add is this:  Check the items in lab02.   For each one, did they do it or not?   You are not assigning a "grade", but you are making a check list and commenting on each item and drawing attention to things that are either particularly good, acceptable, or missing or problematic.  Think of it as making a checklist of  +, ok, -.  

Note that this is *not a grade*.  It is "feedback".  

True: the TAs might use it in deciding where to put their attention when assigning a grade, but they will make an indepdendent judgement before doing so.    This is a *very* important distinction to preserve, not just as a "notion", but in spirit and in truth.

You may also add some encouraging comment or hints about what the students should be doing as they move into the "complete the first 250 or 500 points of their assignment" phase (e.g. M16 lab04, and beyond.)
