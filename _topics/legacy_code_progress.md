This article describes what mentors should be doing during the time that students are assigned to work on legacy code, 
such as during this lab from M16:

* [UCSB CS56 M16 lab04](http://ucsb-cs56-m16.github.io/lab/lab04/)

The most important thing for you to do during lab is to *proactively* check in with *each pair* (or individual or trio) assigned to you
that should be there in lab.

The first thing to check is: "did they show up?"  If they did not, send them a message (I suggest via private message on Piazza, cc'd to "Instructors")
that asks about their welfare.    You can keep it friendly, and you can "assume", to help them save face, that they are not in lab for a good reason, i.e.
that they are sick, had a car accident, etc.   So, ask something like the following.  Put it in your own words, using whatever
way of communicating is natural for you.

>    I'm concerned because I didn't see you in lab.  
>    Is everything ok? I hope you are not sick, and that you were not in an accident, etc.
>    Please check in with me about your progress as soon as you can.  
>    As your mentor, I'm responsible (for my
>    own course grade) to help you succeed in the course as best I can.
>    Please let me know where you stand with (here, mention whatever work is due).

The second thing is to check on their progress.  Students may have a tendency to be:

* Be "behind", say working on lab03, when they should be finished with it by now and working on lab04
    * In this case, encourage them to finish up lab03, and try to get them to commit to some timeline for finishing.  Ask if they 
      are "stuck" on anything specific.  
      

In general, encourage your mentees to be in touch with you, or post on Piazza, if they run into problems.
Remind them that they can post private messages to you on Piazza.  Remind them they can include, or not include, their instructors,
their pair partners, etc. on those messages.
