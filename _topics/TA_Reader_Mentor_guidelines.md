desc: "A general list of blanket course policies that every TA, Reader and Mentor should be aware of"

This list of policies is in no particular order other than the one in which these issues arose.

Each of this is here because at some point, a TA, Reader or Mentor was unaware of some policy and it created confusion, uncertainty, misunderstanding, or doubt.

So, these clarifications are here for your protection.

Many of these policies may seem harsh.   Please know that it is not in my nature to want to have harsh course policies, so in each case,
the policy is "cruel only to be kind", in the sense that I've found that having less harsh policies leads to a kind of chaos that 
takes a heavy toll on the TA, Reader and Instructor.  

If students always acted reasonably and responsibly&mdash;or if the number of students were small enough that the number of "exceptions" was managable, these draconian measures would not be needed.   That has not been my experience over
my experience, though&mdash;and having done this full time since 1997, and at UCSB since 2007, that's a lot of experience.

# Do NOT accept homework outside of the class in which it is due.

Each homework assignment clearly states, at the top, something like the following (the exact wording may vary from
quarter-to-quarter, class to class, but it will be something like this)

> MAY ONLY BE TURNED IN IN THE LECTURE/LAB LISTED ABOVE AS THE DUE DATE,
> OR IF APPLICABLE, SUBMITTED ON GRADESCOPE. There is NO MAKEUP for missed assignments;
> in place of that, we drop the three lowest scores (if you have zeros, those are the three lowest scores.)

One very important implication of that is this: if a student tries to hand you a homework assignment, and it is OUTSIDE of the
class in which it is due, whether early, or late, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT IT.    Unless you have been told otherwise by the instructor directly, 
refuse to accept it, and cite the course policy.     If you accept it, it may be interpreted by the student 
that they have discharged their responsibility to submit the homework.   If you do make this error, let the instructor know as soon as possible.

# Do NOT accept homework handed in "in the wrong pile"

Related to the previous item...

If you are in charge of processing the "pile" for, say Homework H14, and a student simply "leaves" say, an H13 or H15 paper in the "pile" for H14, the proper response
is to send a notice to that student (perhaps by private instructor note on Piazza, or an email cc'd to the instructor 
and other TAs) that you cannot accept their submission because it was not made on the day the assignment was due.  Refer to the policy
printed on each assignment.   

(There are occasional exceptions to this policy, but if/when there are, they will be CLEARLY ANNOUNCED
by the instructor by Piazza, Gauchospace, Slack, in person, etc.)

It is then up to you what you do with the assignment:
* On a first offense, it would be an act of kindness to offer to return the paper during your next office hours or the next lab.   Note, however,
that this requires you to keep hold of this paper from a student that violated a course policy, which is an extra administrative burden on you. As a result, you are NOT REQUIRED TO DO THIS.  You *may*, but you don't have to.
* Or, you may simply discard it.     Certainly on a second offense by the same student, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do.   This is one of the reasons for cc'ing the instructor, and other TAs and Readers: so that they can check to see if the student is a repeat offender.
