# Starting the lab section.  

At least one of the TAs should make an announcement at the start of the lab section, something like this:

* "My name is _____ and I'm the lead TA for this section.  I'm assisted today by ____ who is also a TA, as well
as these mentors:  ______ (introduce them and have them wave as you mention their names, or have them introduce themselves)"

   * Conrad says: "I prefer if you introduce yourself each week by name.  But if you find that awkward, at least write the
      name of the TAs on the whiteboard."

* We are working on labs lab00 and lab01 today.  You can find them on the website.  The URL for the website is https://ucsb-cs56-f17.github.io as you can see here
   on the whiteboard.
   
* The due dates for those labs are on the website.   

* Please turn in your homework ___ and pick up the paper for ____ today.

* If you have any questions, please ask one of the TAs or mentors for help.

# During the very first lab section of the quarter

* Most of you are probably familiar with the CSIL computers from your previous courses: CS16,24,32.  But if you are, for example, 
    a junior transfer, and this is your first CS course at UCSB, please let us know and we'll guide you through getting logged on,
    using the Linux system, and bringing up the instructions.
